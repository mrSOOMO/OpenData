 guide you to deploy your application using AWS EC2 instance. However, keep in mind, AWS EC2 service may incur charges. So, it's important to understand the pricing before using AWS services.

Here are the steps you need to follow to deploy your Docker application on an EC2 instance:

Step 1: Go to the AWS Management Console, select EC2 service.

Step 2: Click on Launch Instance button.

Step 3: Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). In this case, select an AMI which supports Docker. You can use an Amazon Linux 2 AMI which includes Docker.

Step 4: Choose an instance type. This depends on your requirement for CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity.

Step 5: Configure instance details such as number of instances, networking, and more. For networking, it is generally a good practice to set up a new VPC for your application.

Step 6: Add storage to your instance. The size of the storage depends on your application's requirements.

Step 7: Add tags to your instance. Tags can help you manage your instances.

Step 8: Configure your instance's security group. You can either create a new security group or select an existing one. Make sure you allow inbound traffic for port 8090 for the app and 5432 for the database from the IP addresses you want to have access, or 0.0.0.0/0 for access from any IP. But remember that 0.0.0.0/0 will make your application public and anyone can access it.

Step 9: Review your instance and launch it.

Step 10: Once the instance is launched, connect to it

you can use EC2 Instance `Connect` button to connect to your instance.
EC2 Instance Connect provides a simple and secure way to connect
to your instances using Secure Shell (SSH).
With EC2 Instance Connect, you can control SSH access to your instances
using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies as well as audit
connection requests with AWS CloudTrail events.

Here is how you can connect using EC2 Instance Connect:

On your EC2 console, select the instance and click "Connect".
Choose "EC2 Instance Connect".
Click "Connect".
A new browser-based SSH connection will be opened for you.
Once connected, you can run commands as if you were using an SSH client.

Note: For EC2 Instance Connect, you need to ensure that your instance is configured to allow EC2 Instance Connect. This is generally the case with Amazon Linux 2, Ubuntu 16.04, and newer versions of these operating systems. If your instance is a different operating system, you might need to make some modifications.

Great! Now, let's continue with pulling and running your Docker images.

You will need to pull the Docker images for your application and database from the Amazon ECR repositories. You can do this with the `docker pull` command.

authenticate by running the get-login-password command:


aws ecr get-login-password --region eu-central-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 383987334637.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com

After running the login command,  pull the Docker image :
For your application, run:

```
docker pull 383987334637.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/twinkler_app:latest

```

And for your database, run:

```
docker pull 383987334637.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/twinkler_db:latest
```

Once the images have been pulled, you can run them using the `docker run` command.

 For your database:

docker run --name=twinkler_db --network=host -e POSTGRES_USER=rspguser -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=rspgpwd -e POSTGRES_DB=twinkler_db -p 5432:5432 -d 383987334637.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/twinkler_db:latest

docker run --name=twinkler_db --network=twinkler_network -e POSTGRES_USER=rspguser -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=rspgpwd -e POSTGRES_DB=twinkler_db -p 5432:5432 -d 383987334637.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/twinkler_db:latest


 And for your application, use the following command:

docker run -d --name twinkler_app --network=host -p 8090:8090 -e POSTGRES_HOST=localhost -e POSTGRES_PORT=5432 383987334637.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/twinkler_app:latest

docker run --name twinkler_app --network twinkler_network -p 8090:8090 -e POSTGRES_HOST=twinkler_db -e POSTGRES_PORT=5432 383987334637.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/twinkler_app:latest




Remember to replace the placeholders with your actual values. If everything works correctly, your application and database should now be running.

To access your application from the outside, you would use the public IP address assigned to your EC2 instance (3.66.227.14 in this case) and the port on which your application is running (8090). So, you would access your application via http://3.66.227.14:8090. You can use this URL to send requests from Postman or any other tool you're using for testing.

You can install Docker on your Amazon Linux 2 instance using the following commands:

1. Update the installed packages and package cache on your instance.
    ```
    sudo yum update -y
    ```

2. Install the most recent Docker Community Edition package.
    ```
    sudo yum install docker -y
    ```

3. Start the Docker service.
    ```
    sudo service docker start
    ```

4. Add the `ec2-user` to the `docker` group so you can execute Docker commands without using `sudo`.
    ```
    sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user
    ```

You will need to log out and log back in again to pick up the new docker group permissions, or you can reboot your instance.

Once you're back in, try running a simple Docker command to verify the installation:
```
docker info
```
This should give you a bunch of information about your Docker installation, and indicate that Docker is working correctly. After Docker is installed, you can proceed to pull your Docker images and run your containers.


To log out, you can simply type `exit` and press enter in the terminal where you're currently logged in:

```bash
exit
```

Then, you can log back in using the same method you used before.

If you prefer to reboot your instance, you can use the following command:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

After the instance has rebooted, you can log back in. Keep in mind that a reboot will momentarily make the instance inaccessible as it goes through the restart process.

When you've logged back in, you can verify that the `ec2-user` is now part of the `docker` group by using the `id` command:

```bash
id
```

This command will output information about the current user, including group membership. You should see `docker` listed among the groups.

After you've rebooted the EC2 instance, you can log back into it in exactly the same way you initially did.

If you used EC2 Instance Connect, follow these steps:

Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
In the navigation pane, choose Instances.
Select the instance you just rebooted.
Choose Connect.
In the Connect To Your Instance dialog box, choose EC2 Instance Connect (browser-based SSH connection), and then choose Connect.

Great! The `docker` group is now listed in the output of the `id` command. This means that the `ec2-user` has permissions to run Docker commands.

Next, let's try to run Docker:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

This command will try to run the `hello-world` Docker image. If Docker is set up correctly, it will download this image (if it's not already present on your system) and run it. The `hello-world` Docker image, when run, prints a hello message and some additional information, which can be helpful for debugging and checking if Docker is installed properly.

Let's configure your AWS CLI. Run this command:

bash
Copy code
aws configure
It will prompt you for your AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key, which you can find from your AWS Management Console.

Please note, these keys are sensitive information and should be kept private. After inputting the keys, it will then ask for Default region name and Default output format, which you can set to eu-central-1 and json respectively.

Here is an example of how the prompt will look like:

bash
Copy code
AWS Access Key ID [None]: YourAccessKeyID
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: YourSecretAccessKey
Default region name [None]: eu-central-1
Default output format [None]: json
After configuring, try running the login command again:

bash
Copy code
aws ecr get-login-password --region eu-central-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 383987334637.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com
If you don't have your access keys or are unsure, you might need to create a new set of keys. Be aware that it's a good practice to create IAM users with the least privilege required to perform their tasks instead of using your root account credentials. Check out AWS's documentation on Managing Access Keys for more information.


The error message suggests that your AWS CLI is not configured with your AWS access keys. These keys are needed to authenticate your AWS CLI with your AWS account.

Let's configure your AWS CLI. Run this command:

```bash
aws configure
```

It will prompt you for your `AWS Access Key ID` and `AWS Secret Access Key`, which you can find from your AWS Management Console.

Please note, these keys are sensitive information and should be kept private. After inputting the keys, it will then ask for `Default region name` and `Default output format`, which you can set to `eu-central-1` and `json` respectively.

```bash
aws ecr get-login-password --region eu-central-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 383987334637.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com
```

If you don't have your access keys or are unsure, you might need to create a new set of keys. Be aware that it's a good practice to create IAM users with the least privilege required to perform their tasks instead of using your root account credentials. Check out [AWS's documentation on Managing Access Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys) for more information.



The error might be because of the incorrect value of the POSTGRES_HOST environment variable in the Docker run command for your twinkler_app container. The value of POSTGRES_HOST should match the name of the container running PostgreSQL which, in this case, seems to be twinkler_db.

It seems you already have set POSTGRES_HOST=twinkler_db in the twinkler_app Docker run command, but the issue persists. This suggests that there might be a networking problem between the two containers.

You need to ensure that both containers are on the same Docker network. You can create a Docker network using:

bash
Copy code
docker network create mynetwork
Then you can add your containers to the same network:

bash
Copy code
docker run --network=mynetwork --name=twinkler_db -e POSTGRES_USER=rspguser -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=rspgpwd -e POSTGRES_DB=twinkler_db -p 5432:5432 -d 383987334637.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/twinkler_db:latest

docker run --network=mynetwork --name twinkler_app -p 8090:8090 -e POSTGRES_HOST=twinkler_db -e POSTGRES_PORT=5432 -d 383987334637.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/twinkler_app
Also, ensure that the twinkler_db container is up and running and the PostgreSQL service is available before you start the twinkler_app container. If the database is not ready when the application starts, it might not be able to establish a connection.

Finally, double-check your application's configuration to ensure it is correctly using the provided environment variables to connect to the database.


To run a database container in your EC2 Docker network, you need to ensure that the container is connected to the desired network. Here's an example of how you can run the database container in your EC2 Docker network:

First, create the Docker network on your EC2 instance if it doesn't exist:

lua
Copy code
docker network create twinkler_network
Run the database container and connect it to the twinkler_network:

css
Copy code
docker run --name twinkler_db --network twinkler_network -p 5432:5432 -d twinkler_db
In this command, we specify the --network flag and provide the network name twinkler_network to connect the container to that network.

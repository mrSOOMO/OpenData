Good morning!  I can guide you through the process of pushing Docker images
to Amazon's Elastic Container Registry (ECR), which is a fully-managed Docker
container registry that makes it easy for developers to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images.

Here are the steps:

**Step 1:** Install the AWS CLI on your host OS
If you haven't already installed the AWS CLI on your machine, you can do it following these instructions: https://aws.amazon.com/cli/

**Step 2:** Configure the AWS CLI
You'll need to configure your AWS credentials, the default region, and the default output format. Run this command in HOST OS CML and follow the prompts:

```
aws configure
```

**Step 3:** Create a repository in Amazon ECR
You need to create a repository in Amazon ECR for each Docker image you want to push.
Run these commands:

```
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name twinkler_app
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name twinkler_db
```

**Step 4:** Authenticate Docker to your Amazon ECR registry
Use the aws ecr get-login-password command to get a password and pipe it to docker login:

```
aws ecr get-login-password --region eu-central-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 383987334637.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com
```
sample:
```
aws ecr get-login-password --region region | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <your_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<your_region>.amazonaws.com
```

**Step 5:** Tag your Docker image
Tag the Docker images with the Amazon ECR registry, repository, and optional image tag name combination to push them to:

```
docker tag twinkler_app:latest 383987334637.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/twinkler_app:latest
docker tag twinkler_db:latest 383987334637.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/twinkler_db:latest
```
sample:
```
docker tag twinkler_app:latest <your_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<your_region>.amazonaws.com/twinkler_app:latest
docker tag twinkler_db:latest <your_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<your_region>.amazonaws.com/twinkler_db:latest
```

**Step 6:** Push the Docker image
Push the Docker images to your newly created AWS ECR repository:

```
docker push 383987334637.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/twinkler_app:latest
docker push 383987334637.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/twinkler_db:latest
```
sample:
```
docker push <your_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<your_region>.amazonaws.com/twinkler_app:latest
docker push <your_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<your_region>.amazonaws.com/twinkler_db:latest
```

Please replace `<your_account_id>` and `<your_region>` with your AWS account ID and your AWS region (for example, us-west-2).

Your Docker images should now be stored in Amazon ECR and ready to be used on AWS!

Guide you to deploy your application using AWS EC2 instance.

Here are the steps you need to follow to deploy your Docker application on an EC2 instance:
Here are the steps you need to follow to deploy your Docker application on an EC2 instance:

Step 1: Go to the AWS Management Console, select EC2 service.

Step 2: Click on Launch Instance button.

Step 3: Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). In this case, select an AMI which supports Docker. You can use an Amazon Linux 2 AMI which includes Docker.

Step 4: Choose an instance type. This depends on your requirement for CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity.

Step 5: Configure instance details such as number of instances, networking, and more. For networking, it is generally a good practice to set up a new VPC for your application.

Step 6: Add storage to your instance. The size of the storage depends on your application's requirements.

Step 7: Add tags to your instance. Tags can help you manage your instances.

Step 8: Configure your instance's security group. You can either create a new security group or select an existing one. Make sure you allow inbound traffic for port 8090 for the app and 5432 for the database from the IP addresses you want to have access, or 0.0.0.0/0 for access from any IP. But remember that 0.0.0.0/0 will make your application public and anyone can access it.

Step 9: Review your instance and launch it.

Step 10: Once the instance is launched, connect to it


Here is how you can connect using EC2 Instance Connect:

On your EC2 console, select the instance and click "Connect".
A new browser-based SSH connection will be opened for you.
Once connected, you can run commands as if you were using an SSH client.

authenticate by running the get-login-password command:
aws ecr get-login-password --region eu-central-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 383987334637.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com

After running the login command,  pull the Docker image :

For your application, run:
```
docker pull 383987334637.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/twinkler_app:latest
```

And for your database, run:
```
docker pull 383987334637.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/twinkler_db:latest
```

Once the images have been pulled, you can run them using the `docker run` command.

 For your database:

docker run --name=twinkler_db --network=host -e POSTGRES_USER=rspguser -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=rspgpwd -e POSTGRES_DB=twinkler_db -p 5432:5432 -d 383987334637.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/twinkler_db:latest

 And for your application, use the following command:

docker run -d --name twinkler_app --network=host -p 8090:8090 -e POSTGRES_HOST=localhost -e POSTGRES_PORT=5432 383987334637.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/twinkler_app:latest




To access your application from the outside, you would use the public IP address assigned to your EC2 instance (3.66.227.14 in this case) and the port on which your application is running (8090). So, you would access your application via http://3.66.227.14:8090. You can use this URL to send requests from Postman or any other tool you're using for testing.

You can install Docker on your Amazon Linux 2 instance using the following commands:

1. Update the installed packages and package cache on your instance.
    ```
    sudo yum update -y
    ```

2. Install the most recent Docker Community Edition package.
    ```
    sudo yum install docker -y
    ```

3. Start the Docker service.
    ```
    sudo service docker start
    ```

4. Add the `ec2-user` to the `docker` group so you can execute Docker commands without using `sudo`.
    ```
    sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user
    ```

You will need to log out and log back in again to pick up the new docker group permissions, or you can reboot your instance.

Once you're back in, try running a simple Docker command to verify the installation:
```
docker info
```
This should give you a bunch of information about your Docker installation, and indicate that Docker is working correctly. After Docker is installed, you can proceed to pull your Docker images and run your containers.


To log out, you can simply type `exit` and press enter in the terminal where you're currently logged in:

```
exit
```

Then, you can log back in using the same method you used before.

If you prefer to reboot your instance, you can use the following command:

```
sudo reboot
```

After the instance has rebooted, you can log back in. Keep in mind that a reboot will momentarily make the instance inaccessible as it goes through the restart process.

When you've logged back in, you can verify that the `ec2-user` is now part of the `docker` group by using the `id` command:

```
id
```

This command will output information about the current user, including group membership. You should see `docker` listed among the groups.

After you've rebooted the EC2 instance, you can log back into it in exactly the same way you initially did.


Great! The `docker` group is now listed in the output of the `id` command. This means that the `ec2-user` has permissions to run Docker commands.

Next, let's try to run Docker:

```
docker run hello-world
```

This command will try to run the `hello-world` Docker image. If Docker is set up correctly, it will download this image (if it's not already present on your system) and run it. The `hello-world` Docker image, when run, prints a hello message and some additional information, which can be helpful for debugging and checking if Docker is installed properly.

Let's configure your AWS CLI. Run this command:
```
aws configure
```
It will prompt you for your AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key, which you can find from your AWS Management Console.

Please note, these keys are sensitive information and should be kept private. After inputting the keys, it will then ask for Default region name and Default output format, which you can set to eu-central-1 and json respectively.

Here is an example of how the prompt will look like:

```
AWS Access Key ID [None]: YourAccessKeyID
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: YourSecretAccessKey
Default region name [None]: eu-central-1
Default output format [None]: json
After configuring, try running the login command again:
```

```
aws ecr get-login-password --region eu-central-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 383987334637.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com
```
If you don't have your access keys or are unsure, you might need to create a new set of keys. Be aware that it's a good practice to create IAM users with the least privilege required to perform their tasks instead of using your root account credentials. Check out AWS's documentation on Managing Access Keys for more information.



OPTIONAL
create docker network in running ec2 instance:
```
docker network create mynetwork

responce: network=f73521583efe862f398b3d719d6f958367cf773305dabb5fd4035e6c18e09dc7
```

run app in docker network map ports and set envs for db:
```
docker run -d --network=f73521583efe862f398b3d719d6f958367cf773305dabb5fd4035e6c18e09dc7 --name=twinkler_app -p 8090:8090 -e POSTGRES_HOST=host.docker.internal -e POSTGRES_PORT=5432 -d 383987334637.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/twinkler_app:latest
```
or
```
docker run -d --network=mynetwork --name=twinkler_app -p 8090:8090 -e POSTGRES_HOST=host.docker.internal -e POSTGRES_PORT=5432 -d 383987334637.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/twinkler_app:latest
